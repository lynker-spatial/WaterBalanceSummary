\title{Plot Change in Well Water Level vs Model Recharge}
\usage{
Plot_WWLvsSTR(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame that must include:
\describe{
  \item{date}{The date of the observation.}
  \item{mean_change_mm}{The mean change in well water level in millimeters.}
  \item{deltaSTR}{The change in storage from the model.}
  \item{Divide}{The divide ID.}
  \item{source}{The data source (e.g., CABCM, TerraClim).}
}}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing the bar plot with well water levels and model storage changes.
}
\description{
This function generates a bar plot comparing well water level changes (`mean_change_mm`)
with model-reported change in storage (`deltaSTR`) for different divides.
}
\details{
The plot displays well water level changes and model-reported storage changes over time,
with separate facets for each divide. The fill color distinguishes between recharge and
delta storage.
