\title{Create a Scatter Plot Comparing Well Water Level Change and Model Recharge}
\usage{
ModelScatter(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame that must include:
\describe{
  \item{mean_change_mm}{The mean change in well water level in millimeters.}
  \item{deltaSTR}{The change in storage from the model.}
  \item{plot_titles}{Titles for facets, usually including divide ID and correlation coefficient.}
  \item{source}{The data source (e.g., CABCM, TerraClim).}
}}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing the scatter plot comparing well water levels and model storage changes.
}
\description{
This function generates a scatter plot comparing well water level changes (`mean_change_mm`)
with model-reported change in storage (`deltaSTR`) for different data sources.
}
\details{
The scatter plot displays the relationship between well water level changes and model storage
changes, with separate facets for each set of plot titles. The plot helps in visualizing
how well the model predictions align with observed changes.
