\title{Create a Map of Correlations Between Well Water Level and Model Recharge}
\usage{
ModelCorrMap(x = model_correlation_by_divide, y = ModelScatterPlot)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame resulting from the `Correlation()` function, containing:
\describe{
  \item{Divide}{The divide ID.}
  \item{correlation}{The correlation coefficient between `mean_change_mm` and `deltaSTR`.}
}}

\item{y}{A `ggplot` object produced by the `ModelScatter` function, representing the scatter plot
of well water level change vs. model recharge.}
}
\value{
A combined `ggplot` object with the correlation map and scatter plot side by side.
}
\description{
This function generates a map visualizing the correlation between well water level changes and
model-reported recharge. It colors divides based on whether the correlation is positive or negative.
It also combines this map with a scatter plot showing the relationship between well water levels and
model recharge.
}
\details{
The function takes in the output from the `Correlation()` function and uses it to create a map that
highlights divides with positive and negative correlations. It adds labels and includes various map
features like scale and north arrow. The combined map and scatter plot provide a comprehensive view
of the correlation analysis.
