<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of WaterBalanceSummary is to create water balance plots, seasonal error plots, compare well water level with soil moisture from aggregated meteorological data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of WaterBalanceSummary from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("lynker-spatial/WaterBalanceSummary")
```

#### You can use this package to produce detailed figures for analysis of your model compared to real world data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(c("vignettes/images/CorrPlotExample.png", "vignettes/images/WWLvsSTR_Example.png"))

```

#### To visualize the water balance of a basin

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/images/ExampleBalancePlot.png")

```

#### And to locate where model data and real world data do and do not align

```{r, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/images/ExampleSeasonPlot.png")

```
